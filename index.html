        <p>Hello my name is Alexis Velasquez and im a junior frontend developer. Ever since i was a litte boy the though process of building craffts or building science projects would really bring intrest. I realized i could relate this process with code. There are endless possibilies on building whatever you want from a blog website to an e-commerce business. I enjoy building, creating and bringing projects to life, lets work on your idea! </p>

            <p>In the beginning the process was a bit challenging getting the form set up at the top of the page. the css was giving me problems on the width dimensions. I overall enjoyed the project it gave me a better understanding of how to manage flexbox and to better use classes and ids as well as being able to differentiate them on their purpose. </p>
