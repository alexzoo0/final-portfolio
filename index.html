            <p>In the beginning the process was a bit challenging getting the form set up at the top of the page. the css was giving me problems on the width dimensions. I overall enjoyed the project it gave me a better understanding of how to manage flexbox and to better use classes and ids as well as being able to differentiate them on their purpose. </p>
